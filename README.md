# Batton_Assignment

## Overview

This project focuses on automating the rotation of PDF documents by 90 degrees counterclockwise and efficiently creating multiple copies of the rotated file.

## Features

- **PDF Rotation**: Utilizes PyMuPDF to rotate PDF pages by 90Â° CCW.
- **Batch Copying**: Creates multiple copies (e.g., 10 and 50) of the rotated PDF.
- **Performance Metrics**: Measures and logs the time taken and file sizes for each copy.


## Repository Structure

- `Batton_Assignment_code.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the implementation code.
- `assignment.pdf`: Original PDF file used as input.
- `output.pdf`: Intermediate output file.
- `output_rotated.pdf`: Final rotated PDF file.
- `Report_ Image File Rotation Algorithm Implementation and Analysis_.pdf`: Detailed report of the project's methodology and findings.

## Installation

### Clone the repository

```bash
pip install pymupdf 
git clone https://github.com/rsrajahnsa/Batton_Assignment.git
cd Batton_Assignment
